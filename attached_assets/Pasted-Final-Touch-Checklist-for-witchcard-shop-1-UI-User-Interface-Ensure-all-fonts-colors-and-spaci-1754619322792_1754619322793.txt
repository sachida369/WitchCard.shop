Final Touch Checklist for witchcard.shop
1. UI (User Interface)
 Ensure all fonts, colors, and spacing match the mystical/witch theme.

 Align all buttons and input fields consistently across pages.

 Apply hover effects and active states to all clickable elements.

 Check mobile responsiveness for all breakpoints (320px → 1920px).

 Add rounded edges & subtle shadows to cards and product blocks.

 Ensure map, forms, and scratch areas are aligned in both desktop and mobile.

 Fix any misaligned form elements (especially on Kundali & scratch pages).

2. UX (User Experience)
 Add loading indicators/spinners where API calls happen (Kundali, payment, scratch reveal).

 Disable payment buttons until all required fields are valid.

 Add smooth scrolling to sections when navigating via menu or CTA buttons.

 After payment success, show a clear "Thank You" + next step message.

 Show tooltips or placeholders for inputs like DOB, TOB, and Place.

 Make error messages clear, friendly, and in brand tone.

 Add one-tap WhatsApp share from product and result pages.

3. SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
 Write unique Title Tags and Meta Descriptions for each page:

Home

Products

Kundali

Scratch Cards

 Add H1, H2, H3 hierarchy with keywords.

 Use descriptive alt attributes for all images.

 Create a sitemap.xml and submit to Google Search Console.

 Add Open Graph (OG) tags for better sharing previews on social media.

 Use clean, keyword-friendly URLs (/kundali.html, /scratch-cards).

 Minimize duplicate content — ensure each product has unique text.

4. Content
 Add clear, benefit-driven product descriptions.

 Include mystical storytelling for Kundali, scratch cards, and numerology products.

 Add FAQs on each service page (helps SEO + customer trust).

 Include terms, privacy policy, and refund policy (linked in footer).

 Proofread all text for grammar and consistency in tone.

5. Images
 Compress all images using WebP or AVIF for faster loading.

 Maintain high quality while optimizing file size (< 200 KB where possible).

 Ensure all hero images are lazy-loaded to speed up above-the-fold rendering.

 Keep consistent aspect ratio for product thumbnails.

 Add mystical/neon glow effects where appropriate.

6. Site Loading & Performance
 Use minified CSS & JS.

 Load non-critical JS with defer or async.

 Use a CDN for images and static assets.

 Implement browser caching for static resources.

 Test load time with Google PageSpeed Insights and aim for 90+ score.

 Remove unused CSS & JS (tree-shaking).

7. Payment Button Functionality
 Ensure Razorpay SDK is loaded on all pages that need payments.

 Check payment button states — disable when inputs are invalid.

 Verify correct amount and description passed to Razorpay.

 Test failed payment scenarios and retry flow.

 Display clear confirmation after success (with order ID).

 Integrate backend verification for payment success before generating content.

8. API Functionality
 Confirm backend endpoints (/api/kundli, etc.) are deployed and secured.

 Hide API keys in .env (never expose in frontend).

 Handle API errors gracefully — show friendly message to user.

 Add rate limiting or abuse protection on backend endpoints.

 Test all Prokerala API requests with both valid and invalid inputs.

 Ensure map search, coordinates, and data fetching work on mobile and desktop.

9. Products Page
 Display all products in a grid layout with proper spacing.

 Add "Pay Now" and "Share on WhatsApp" buttons for each product.

 Show product price clearly.

 Allow sorting/filtering if you have many products.

 Ensure each product links to a detailed page (optional but better UX).

 Make the products page responsive (2-column mobile, 4-column desktop).

 Highlight best-selling products with a badge.

10. Final Pre-Launch Checks
 Test entire purchase flow from mobile and desktop.

 Check for console errors in Chrome DevTools.

 Validate HTML & CSS via W3C validator.

 Verify all internal links work.

 Test on at least 3 browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari.

 Backup current working version before deploying changes.
